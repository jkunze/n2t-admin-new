# This bash script sets some instance-specific environment variables.

# Set the canonical HOSTNAME for our web server.  Why not figure it out
# from the "hostname" command?  Because the name we want to appear in the
# published URL may have nothing to do with what "hostname" returns, eg,
# n2t.net != catbird.ucop.edu.
#
export HOSTNAME=xxxxxxx.cdlib.org

# Set N2T_CLASS to define service class.
#    prod	# production
#    stage 	# stable-ish
#    dev 	# all others
#
export N2T_CLASS=dev

# Set N2T_INSTANCE_MARK to a single character code for the instance that
# will appear in a subtle part of the resolver's home page (eg, footer).
#    C		# CDL
#    E		# EDINA
#
export N2T_INSTANCE_MARK=C

# Set N2T_REPLICAS to define a server that updates replicas given as a
# set of comma-separated hostname=N pairs, where N is the number of
# minutes between updates and hostname identifies the replica server.
#
export N2T_REPLICAS=n2tlx.edina.ac.uk=5

# Set N2T_BACKUPDIR to define where the backups directory will be created.
# For example, on a production class machine it may be better to have the
# main binder on a different disk from the backup binders, because creating
# backups to/from one disk can cause enough i/o contention to slow down the
# production system.  XXX creation of the symlink is not automated!
#
export N2T_BACKUPDIR=$HOME

# Set N2T_BACKUPS to define backups for various binders.  The value is a
# comma-separated set of <binder>=<num> pairs, where <num> is the maximum
# number of daily backups to keep (zero means no maximum).  No backups are
# made for binders that aren't listed.
#
export N2T_BACKUPS=ezid=8,yamz=1	# keep up to 8 daily backups
