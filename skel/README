This is the home directory of the N2T service and n2t role account.

To administer the N2T service, use init.d/apache.n2t.  Examples:

    init.d/apache.n2t status
    init.d/apache.n2t restart
    init.d/apache.n2t stop
    init.d/apache.n2t start

Various tools are in ~/local/bin, including a web client for testing this
the eggnog software supporting N2T.  Type "weggnog" to read about that.

The running service is found in sv/cur ("service version -- current").
Other "service versions" can be found in, for example, sv/new and sv/old.
Type "svu" to read about it.

At almost all times, "svu cur" should be in effect; you'll know that when
you see something like "[svu cv2:cur]" in your prompt.  The environment
and shell variable, $sv (yes, lowercase), expands to the current "svu"
directory.  All service versions are highly parallel, with the web server
always in $sv/apache2.

The big exception is the instance-unique data stored in the minters,
binders, and shoulders located under

    $sv/apache2/{minters,binders,shoulders}

It is ok to use symlinks from outside and pointing into an $sv tree (eg,
from init.d/apache.n2t linking with sv/cur), but DON'T use symlinks from
INSIDE an $sv tree to point to itself -- otherwise system dependencies
will be corrupted with the next "svu" rollout/rollback.

Scripts for installing the system from scratch are found in

    n2t_create

which is its own hg repo.  For example, this README file is maintained by
doing "cd n2t_create; vi skel/README; make".

The N2T system is built in $sv/build.  There you will find various repos,
the main one being $sv/build/eggnog.
