Overview
N2T provides minting, binding, and resolution services with ARK and DOI identifiers for several clients, the most important of which is the EZID service.  While N2T supplies its primary backend storage, EZID is managed as a separate, independent service (see EZID Operations --secured).  Other clients, used mainly for resolution, include the Internet Archive's Open Content Alliance (OCA) and the YAMZ metadictionary. Per an MOU with the EMBL-EBI, on a daily basis N2T harvests "prefix" records from Identifiers.org to support "compact identifiers".

All functions are served from an Apache web server homed at n2t.net. A replica web server (a read-only mirror) running at EDINA in Edinburgh, Scotland is updated from the primary N2T server on a regular basis via "cron".  

The N2T web server runs under Amazon Web Services (AWS).  A typical instance is an Amazon Linux AMI using the open-source Eggnog package (formerly Noid) to mint, bind, and resolve identifiers. Egg is for binding (storing) and resolving, and nog (nice opaque generator) is used for minting. Eggnog is written in Perl and uses the open-source BerkeleyDB software as a fast, scalable database. Resolution is provided by Apache server rewrite rules hooked up to egg binders. Also on N2T are administrative scripts written in Bash for creating and managing identifier prefixes (shoulders), backing up the database, updating replica servers, and documents to support these functions.

All the above functionality is installed identically on the EDINA replica under a RedHat Linux VM at n2tlx.edina.ac.uk, but all functions are disabled by policy flags, with the exception of resolution. Furthermore, no traffic going to n2t.net will be served by n2tlx unless and until EDINA staff are authorized to advertize n2t.net as a synonym for n2tlx. Therefore, the EDINA replica is currently inactive except to those who know how to demo its resolution function.


Instances
There are several instances of N2T running at CDL in Oakland and Berkeley, California, as well as a replica N2T service in Edinburgh. While most instances are running under Linux, there is a legacy instance and some support scripts still running under Solaris.  The Amazon production and stage URLs each point to an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) not described here; under each ELB there is currently only one N2T instance.

The Linux environments in which these instances run (the filesystems, role accounts, permissions, package dependencies, etc.) are mostly identical except for slight configuration differences as indicated in the table below. Effort is made to ensure that all instances are running the same version of the N2T code, but differences do occasionally creep in (as when, for example, a change has not yet been pushed to production).

The name "staging" above is a little misleading, as it is more like a second development instance.

To bring up N2T "from scratch" on a brand new host, create an empty director ~/n2t_create, copy in the ec2_bootmake script, and run it.


Common filesystem layout
All instances of N2T have the same filesystem layout, although there are certain directories and binders (databases) that are used regularly only on the primary instance.  For example, the production directories that support shoulder creation, replication, backups, and logging are used only on the production instance; except for keeping the binders up-to-date on the replica instance, no other attempt is made to synchronize such directories.  The result is that, on non-production instances, binders and directories designed to hold data, are often vestigial or contain test data of no lasting value.

In the filesystem names below, a terminal '/' indicates a directory and the color red indicates a symbolic link.

warts/env.sh (sets instance-specific environment variables)
The  ~n2t/.bashrc file defines two critical things:

PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH
function svu { eval `svu_run "$PS1"\|\|\|b "$@"`; }
When "svu cur" is in effect, $PATH is modified by prepending the current service "bin" directory to it, and $PERL_INSTALL_BASE is similarly modified.  Other useful things are defined as well, including

# Some aliases that make n2t/eggnog development and testing easier.
#
alias blib="perl -Mblib"
# $PERL_INSTALL_BASE interpolated at run time, eg, when "svu cur" in effect
alias mkperl='perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=$PERL_INSTALL_BASE'


Administration: starting & stopping
Administering N2T is done while logged in to the "n2t" role account. The following script provides the basic controls:

~/n2t/init.d/apache start|stop|restart|status

Another script, /etc/init.d/apache.n2t, calls this script on machine boot and shutdown.

For maintenance downtimes that you expect to last (or that end up lasting) over a minute, it is best to suspend Nagios (see Administration: monitoring) using, for example, the "scheduled downtime" menu selection, so that other staff won't be inconvenienced by unnecessary alerts.


Administration: server status
The status of the production N2T server can be viewed by logging in via ssh to n2t@ids-n2t-prd-2a.n2t.net and running

$ ~/init.d/apache status
success: N2T is up

The underlying API method is described in the API documentation, which can be viewed at The N2T API.


Administration: resolver status
Information about a long-running Perl process that handles all ARK resolution can be viewed from any browser by trying to resolve ark:/99999/__rrminfo__. This is a special ARK (an easter egg), that asks for information from the binder via "rewritemap resolver mode" (the long-running process), and it returns a fake URL destination. For example, to query the production instance,

$ wget -O - n2t.net/ark:/99999/__rrminfo__ 2>&1 | grep Location
Location: http://www.example.com/embrpt/1.00/1.83/4.007025/4.7/11598/2015.02.21_23:11:51?\
dvcsid=9e1430c24de8&rmap=/apps/n2t/sv/cv2/apache2/htdocs/a/ezid/rmap_ezid [following]

Entered into a regular browser, the special ARK will appear to fail, but the actual information you want will be conveyed in the text of the URL displayed in the location bar. In the URL path will be found version numbers for (using "embrpt" as mnemonic) egg, BerkeleyDB module, built with which BDB C library, and running dynamically linked against which BDB C library, followed by process id and build time.  In the query string will be found the changeset id (dvcsid), and script name (rmap).


Administration: pausing the server
While there is currently no straightforward way to pause N2T, there are some actions (from the n2t role account only) that effectively pause all write operations on a binder, such as when a backup is done ("egg -d ezid dbsave ..."). You can artificially pause a binder from the role account from a terminal window by running, for example, "egg -d ezid --lock dbinfo all | more", leaving the "more" pager on the first page, and unpause it by quitting the pager.


Administration: patching the operating system
Installing operating system updates (often needed for security reasons) consists of a patching step, an optional machine reboot step, and a testing step.

Patching step.  Under AWS patching is done with "admegn sysupdate", which ultimately calls "sudo yum update".   
Rebooting step.  If a reboot is required, the safest way to prepare for it in the current production configuration, is to start no sooner than 1 minute after the beginning of the advertised maintenance window, giving customer processes that observe the same window a chance to finish pausing.  In addition, because the production instance is a single EC2 instance behind a load balancer, it is best to avoid system downtime when an EC2 healthcheck comes in.  So on the production host, use "admegn pingwhen" to observe the periodicity of the monitoring health checks (look for "WebInject") and time your reboot to happen just after the next check.  If a check comes in when the system is down, the greater the chance of the instance being taken out of load balancer rotation" and the greater the apparent downtime to users.  The following reboot procedure, which relies on several open terminal windows, is advised.
window A: ssh session into production
window B: to monitor and pause EZID (N2T's most important client) while N2T is rebooting
window C: a non-production machine (eg, laptop) from which you will initiate the reboot
To start (if patching, do that first, then), from window A understand when the healthchecks occur.  Note that by current local AWS policy, the load balancer ("WebInject") healthchecks may be suspended during EZID's standard maintenance period; if so this step may not be necessary. 
  admegn pingwhen                                     # look for the timing of "WebInject" checks
  admegn pingwhen                                     # just before pausing EZID, verify latest check
From window B you may wish to see how busy EZID is in that moment.
  ezcl p admin:$(wegnpw ezidadmin) pause monitor      # if you're ready to pause EZID; Control-C to end
  ezcl p admin:$(wegnpw ezidadmin) pause on           # CAREFUL! – EZID is PAUSED until you UNPAUSE!
From window C, initiate and monitor the reboot, to let you know when the system is back up and how long it was down.
  admegn bootwatch ids-n2t-prd-2a.n2t.net n2t.net     # reboots remote system
Keeping an eye on window B during this time, verify that the ssh session in window A has disconnected.
From window B, when the system comes back up (as reported in window C), make sure to unpause EZID.
  ezcl p admin:$(wegnpw ezidadmin) pause off          # UNPAUSE EZID; VERY IMPORTANT!!
  ezcl p admin:$(wegnpw ezidadmin) pause monitor      # to verify that EZID is unpaused!

Testing step.  The most important test of whether EZID is working is to create a demo ARK at ezid.cdlib.org from a browser window and watch the ezcl p ... monitor output until the binder queue drains. If that test fails, try to visit n2t.net from a browser window, and log back in to production in window A to run post-reboot tests from the shell.
  n2t test                                            # test script (some failed tests may be normal)

Administration: monitoring
There are several sources of system monitoring.  All sources notify of outages but take no action themselves.

From CDL, monitoring of CDL hosts is managed by Nagios, with email notification going to the developers' email addresses.
From EDINA, monitoring of the replica is done via a proxy (a load balancer).  With only one VM actually running the replica at "n2tlx.edina.ac.uk", the proxy selects the VM if it is up, and redirects to a standard EDINA error page otherwise.  Email notification goes to n2t@cdlib.org which forwards to the n2t role account, where the ~/.forward file sends it on to relevant staff.
From monitor.us (a free monitoring service), outage notifications for the primary and replica instances are sent to jak@ucop.edu.
For CDL monitors, action is required because CDL and UCOP staff pay close attention to service faults and will take steps to restart the service themselves unless you formally "acknowledge" the faults.

An easy way to acknowledge a fault is to reply to the emailed Nagios notification, but this must be done from Outlook mail (eg, not gmail), making the first line of the reply of this form:

ACK I am working on this. -John ENDACK

Alternatively, you may login to Nagios at https://cdl-aws-nagios.cdlib.org/ with your dev/stg (UCOP CDL LDAP) credentials, select Hosts from the left pane, select the specific host that faulted (n2t*), and select "Acknowledge..." from the Service Commands pane.

If a service is purposely taken offline, communicate that fact by formally per instructions documented in the CDL Nagios User's Guide.


Administration: maintaining the ARK NAAN registry
To get started, go into the ~/naans directory, type "./form2naa", and follow the instructions there. This directory has its own Bitbucket repository (this section is a work in progress)


Administration: setting up and tearing down shoulders and EZID accounts
To get started, go into the ~/shoulders directory, type "make_ezacct", and follow the instructions there.  (this section is a work in progress)

To tear things down, a number of procedures are documented here: Transferring a client from EZID to another provider* .


Administration: contacts and after-hours IT help
For after-hours help with the CDL instances, contact the UCOP ITS Helpdesk at helpdesk@ucop.edu or 510-987-0349. If urgent help is needed to correct a serious problem, follow this procedure.

Call 510-987-0349 to describe the problem, ask the person to contact the "UNIX On-Call Technician", and have them call you at a number where you can be reached.
After hanging up, call Kurt Ewoldsen (CDL's IAS Service Manager) at 510-812-6635 to tell him about the problem.
After hanging up, send email to helpdesk@ucop.edu and Kurt.Ewoldsen@ucop.edu to create a written record of the contact.
For questions about the EDINA instance, contact edina.infrastructure@ed.ac.uk (as of writing, this may reach david.elsmore@ed.ac.uk or matt.hodson@ed.ac.uk).


Source code
The source code is managed using Mercurial. There are eight central source code repositories located at bitbucket.org: one for the eggnog package, one for system and role account initialization (n2t_create), one for performing service roll out/back (svu), one for NAAN and shoulder management (NAANager), and four for separate Perl modules (newer than their CPAN counterparts). To access a repository, you'll need a personal Mercurial/RhodeCode account on hg.cdlib.org, and your account must have been granted access to the repository by the administrator (currently Martin.Haye@ucop.edu).

eggnog repository
Purpose: main software (Perl and Bash) behind the N2T service
Central repository URL: ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/cdl/n2t-eggnog
Local filesystem: ~/sv/cur/build/eggnog
Description: egg, nog, and anvl2egg commands, plus various Perl modules, config files, Bash scripts, and numerous test suites
n2t_create repository
Purpose: automated N2T system build and initialization
Central repository URL: ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/cdl/n2t-admin
Local filesystem: ~/n2t_create
Description: creates system software stack and role account from scratch
naans repository
Purpose: record of NAAN registry changes
Central repository URL: ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/jak/naans
Local filesystem: ~/naans
Description: global ARK registry, drives N2T resolution for external resolvers
svu repository
Purpose: automated Service Version Utility for service rollout and rollback
Central repository URL: ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/cdl/svu
Local filesystem: copied to ~/n2t_create
Description: service version utility for rollout and rollback
shoulders repository
Purpose: 
Central repository URL: ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/cdl/shoulders
Local filesystem: ~/sv/cur/shoulders
Description: NAAN and shoulder management
File-ANVL, File-Namaste, File-Pairtree, File-Value repositories
Purpose: general-purpose supporting Perl modules (newer than their http://search.cpan.org/~jak/ counterparts)
Central repository URLs: ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/cdl/File-...
Local filesystem: ~/sv/cur/build/File-...
At system build time, N2T populator (ie, user) passwords are looked for first in the file ~/warts/.pswdfile.n2t and then in ~/sv/cur/build/eggnog/t/n2t/pswdfile.  Do not put real passwords in the latter file, which is (a) checked into the source repository and (b) meant to be used only for test purposes.

The linkage between a repository in one of the N2T instances and its counterpart on hg.cdlib.org is described in <repo>/.hg/hgrc. As a consequence, it's possible to push and pull without specifying the central repository, e.g.:

cd ~/sv/cur/build/eggnog
hg push|pull|incoming|outgoing|etc.


Command-line tools
The egg command manages binders and the nog command manages minters. To see the state of any binder or minter, use the mstat sub-command, as in

$ nog -d ~/minters/ezid/ark/99999/fk4 mstat
minter: /apps/n2t/minters/ezid/ark/99999/fk4
status: enabled
spings minted: 852651
spings left: unlimited
spings left before blade expansion ("add3"): 69883859
spings held: 0
spings queued: 0
template: 99999/fk4{eedeedk}
sample: 99999/fk40002f9j
original template: 99999/fk4{eedk}
$ egg -d ~/binders/ezid mstat
binder: /apps/n2t/binders/ezid
status: enabled
bindings: 58623062

Other command-line tools (in ~/local/bin) provide a variety of services. To print help information about how to use the tools below, at a shell prompt type the name of the tool with no arguments.

admegn - admin tool for eggnog, eg, admegn backup
mg - mongodb server and result set management
pfx - prefix harvesting, testing, installation
wegn - web eggnog client
ezcl - web EZID client
wegnpw - fetch an N2T user's password
n2t - admin tool for the N2T service, eg, n2t rollout 
bdbkeys - fetch keys and values from one or more Berkeley DB databases

Procedure: code update
Imagine some code changes have been committed and pushed to hg.cdlib.org from dev. To deploy those changes in stage:

Login to n2t@ids-n2t-stg.cdlib.org.
cd $sv/build/eggnog
n2t import
Pause ezid and wait for activeOperations to drain to zero
n2t rollout             # about .5 seconds downtime
Unpause ezid
n2t test
If something goes terribly awry, to rollback to the previous revision:

n2t rollback
n2t test
If everything looks good, repeat the previous steps on the other N2T instances, ending with the production instance.

If you need to install a new version of a major dependency, such as the Perl interpreter, you will want to use "svu new" to install an entire new service version.

cd ~/n2t_create
svu new
vi make_instance              # to change the Perl version to be installed
./make_instance build all     # 15-25 minutes to build full stack of software dependencies and test thoroughly
... svu rollout ...           # not all details have been tested

Cron jobs
A cron job runs every 3 minutes on the primary production instance to update the replica by calling ~n2t/local/bin/replicate. Note that replication as currently implemented can cause a crippling load to the EDINA replica when there are very large numbers of updates, such as when batch changes are occurring; in such cases it may be best to disable replication by commenting out the above line using crontab -e, to copy the database manually to EDINA when all updates are done, and then to restart replication.

Another regular maintenance task is the manual weekly backup of the EZID binder.  This is complemented by daily backups of a separate EZID client-side database.


Passwords, populators, and ports
Information on passwords, populators, and ports is maintained in a separate document.

Personally identifiable information and privacy
N2T stores opaque "agent PIDs" recorded by EZID.  Agent PIDs are viewable only by the administrator.

In its role as maintainer of the NAAN registry for ARK identifiers, N2T stores contact information (names, email addresses, physical addresses, affiliations, phone numbers) associated with NAANs in ~/shoulders/naans/master_naans. Contact information is viewable only by the administrator and is encrypted (lightly) before the registry is replicated (only to sites that do not themselves make such information available).

In its role as maintainer of the EZID shoulder database, N2T stores some EZID login account names in ~/shoulders/master_shoulders.txt. Contact information is viewable only by the administrator.

The identifier operations that a populator (a service, such as EZID, OCA, or YAMZ, not an individual) performs are recorded in N2T's transaction log. Transaction log records are retained indefinitely and are viewable only by N2T software development staff.

The Apache access log includes client/browser IP addresses.  Access log records are retained for six months.
