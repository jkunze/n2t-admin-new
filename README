			N2T INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

N2T (Name-to-Thing) is a resolver and metadata store. This repo contains
most of the administrative and support functions for N2T. It is
complemented by the Eggnog software in a separate repo.

The make_instance script can be read for more insight. It's old and
hasn't been touched in a while, and it should be regarded as pseudo-code.
