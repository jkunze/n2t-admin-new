Usage: $0 [ init | build ]

Use these instructions and script to set up N2T on a new AWS EC2 instance
(SSD and xfs recommended).
Start by assuming the identity of the user (eg, sudo to a role account login)
that you intend will administer the service and change to its home directory.
Roughly, there are two steps: "init" and "build".

Set up yum installation and other foundation files, by running (interactively,
not backgrounding)

      $0 init

and follow the instructions that follow and those that it prints, including:

  1.  Verify that you have correct values for username and cdl.username
      inside your ~/.hgrc file.

  2.  Add your instance's ssh key to bitbucket.org.

      Login to https://bitbucket.org/cdl, click on your avatar, then on
      "bitbucket settings" -> "add ssh key" (or something like that).
      If needed, you can generate it with

        ssh-keygen -t rsa         # enter no filename, no passphrase
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub     # then "copy" contents to clipboard

      Paste it in when bitbucket asks for it. You'll also likely want to
      add this key to other n2t hosts that you'll want to interact with.

  3.  Copy into ~/warts/.pswdfile.n2t the same from from another host, eg,

        scp -p n2t-dev.n2t.net:warts/.pswdfile.n2t ~/warts/

  4.  Make sure that your system people have (a) put your web server certs
      file into the ~/ssl/ directory, (b) added mongodb.repo to
      /etc/yum.repos.d, and (c) opened up access between mongo replicas on
      ports 27017-27027 and 47017-47027.

  5.  Per the cert filename assignments in ~/$envsh, copy the correct
      files from ~/ssl/... into ~/warts/ssl.


Then run

      $0 build

Finally have your system people copy ~/n2t_create/apache.n2t to
/etc/init.d/apache.n2t so that the service comes up and shuts down
properly during system reboots. You'll also want to have web service
monitoring set up, eg, Nagios.
